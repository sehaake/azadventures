          <p>
            A floating wipeout-style obstacle course on the water at Lake Pleasant.

            more playful than just swimming.

          <h3>Bull Pen Swimming Hole</h3>
          <p class="place-subheading">Camp Verde, AZ ~2 hrs away</p>
          <p>
            A clear-water swimming hole near Camp Verde that you reach after a short hike.
            From the trailhead it is around a twenty minute walk to the water, where you will
            find a natural pool and rocky ledges to relax on.

          <h3>Fossil Creek</h3>
          <p class="place-subheading">Strawberry, AZ ~2 hrs 15 min away</p>
          <p>
            A blue creek with waterfalls, small caves, and shaded spots along the water. Depending on the route and season, 
            you can drive in on Forest Road 708 from Highway 260 and access one of the eight parking areas, each with short hikes leading down to water area. 
            This option works best with a high-clearance vehicle, especially after monsoon season. For a longer adventure, you can take the Bob Bear Trail, which is a strenuous 10-mile round-trip hike that leads to the waterfall and classic turquoise swimming areas. Either route gives you a mix of clear water, rocky cliffs, and one of the most unique creek systems in Arizona!
